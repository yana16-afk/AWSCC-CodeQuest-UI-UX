- Link to my own file of **"Week 1 [Day 3] : Activity"** : [Yana's C.R.A.P. Design Principles](https://www.figma.com/file/fczMKJ58lI4ku0C8Qs2uN0/Week-1-%5BDay-3%5D-%3A-Activity-(Community)?type=design&node-id=202%3A38&mode=design&t=dRlhZghlXDbV5sPW-1)

- A **screenshot** of playing the game **"Can't Unsee"** and my feedback

  <br/> FEEDBACK: **_This game got me so serious about playing it but nonetheless, it was entertaining since it tested my eyes when it comes to design principle_**
