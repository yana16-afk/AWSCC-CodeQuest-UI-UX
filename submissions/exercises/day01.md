#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> **User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>

    Answer: _The absence of unnecessary pop-ups or complex menu structures meant I could focus on my shopping tasks without any distractions. The streamlined design and                          straightforward layout allowed for a hassle-free exploration of products, contributing to a more enjoyable and less overwhelming experience compared to Lazada._

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>

    Answer: _Both Shopee and Lazada have visually pleasing designs that align with their brands. Shopee's clean layout, vibrant colors, and recognizable icons create a visually                  consistent and appealing interface that I found engaging. Similarly, Lazada maintains a cohesive design with a distinct visual identity, contributing to an overall                  seamless user interface experience._
